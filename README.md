# FACUPD
MATLAB test code for factorization update of elliptic problems

An example is provided.

The folder FEM/ consists of functions to generate finite element matrices. Most of the scripts come from the nodal-dg package (https://github.com/tcew/nodal-dg). See for referrence Nodal Disontinuous Galerkin Methods by Jan S. Hesthaven and Tim Warburton.

The folder SOL/ contains the factorization and solution scripts.
